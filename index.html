      <p class="headline">Hello, I'm a UI developer with expertise in JavaScript, functional programming and user experience design.</p>

      <h2 id="about-me" class="hr"><span class="hr">ABOUT ME</span></h2>
      <p>Originally from "America's comeback city" -- Cleveland, Ohio, I've been fortunate to have spent time living and working in Columbus, Ohio and Chicago, Illinois. Currently, though, I live in Austin, Texas with my wonderful wife, beautiful baby girl Ramona and one crazy cat, Sgt. Pepper!</p>

      <p>
        In Austin, I work for <a href="https://sailpoint.com/">SailPoint</a>. At SailPoint, we ship SaaS applications in the Identity Governance space. My
        role is largely focused on the UI, but I frequently work across the stack and across departments (UX, Data, Backend, etc) to solve critical problems and add important features for customers
        and internal teams. On the UI end I've architected and delivered applications written in most modern JS frameworks. Most recently, I have built apps with React, Next.js, Node.js, Angular 2+ using both
        TypeScript and JavaScript.
      </p>
      
      <p>Prior to SailPoint, I've worked professionally on a variety of different software projects using languages like Ruby, Java, Perl, Clojure, Objective-C, Swift, among others. My passion, though, has always been building UI and solving UX problems of all kinds.</p>

      <p>My approach to work has always been a combination of software craftsmanship, innovation, continuous learning, and sharing. I take pride in delivering high-quality code that is free of bugs by writing unit tests consistently, performing code reviews, and resolving technical debt where necessary. I quite enjoy learning new programming languages and identifying strengths and weaknesses in solving problems (areas of ongoing interest are functional programming, concurrency and static typing).</p>
