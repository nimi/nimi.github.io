      <p class="headline">Hello, I'm a UI developer with expertise in JavaScript, functional programming and user experience design.</p>

      <h2 id="about-me" class="hr"><span class="hr">ABOUT ME</span></h2>
      <p>Originally from "America's comeback city" -- Cleveland, Ohio, I've been fortunate to have spent time living and working in Austin, Texas and Chicago, Illinois. Currently, though, I live in Columbus, Ohio with my wonderful wife and crazy cat, Sgt. Pepper!</p>

      <p>In Columbus, I work for <a href="http://resourceammirati.com/">Resource/Ammirati</a> (recently acquired by IBM) where we build digital experiences for a wide range of clients. My role is mainly to build and architect large-scale JavaScript applications for clients like Sherwin-Williams, Huntington Bank, and Nestle. We typically use a full-stack JS architecture with either Angular, Backbone or React depending on the project along with NodeJS. Outside of JS, have plenty of web apps that run with .NET or Java. I also sometimes work on building UIs for native iOS (Obj-C/Swift) applications.</p>

      <p>Prior to Resource, I've worked professionally on a variety of different software projects using languages like Ruby, Java, Perl, and PHP. My passion, though, has always been building and designing the UI side of the application with JavaScript.</p>

      <p>My approach to work has always been a combination of software craftsmanship, innovation, continuous learning, and sharing. I take pride in delivering high-quality code that is free of bugs by writing unit tests consistently, performing code reviews, and resolving technical debt where necessary. I quite enjoy learning new programming languages and identifying strengths and weaknesses in solving problems (areas of interest are functional programming, concurrency and static typing).</p>
