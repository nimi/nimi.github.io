      <p class="italic">Hello, I'm a UI developer with expertise in JavaScript, functional programming and user experience design.</p>

      <h2 id="about-me" class="hr"><span class="hr">ABOUT ME</span></h2>
      <p>I'm originally from "America's comeback city" -- Cleveland, Ohio. I also spent few years in Austin, Texas as well as Chicago, Illinois. Currently, though, I live in Columbus, Ohio with my wife and cat, Sargeant Pepper.</p>

      <p>In Columbus, I work for Resource/Ammirati (recently acquired by IBM IX) where we build digital experiences for a wide range of clients. My role is to building and architecting large-scale JavaScript applications for clients like Sherwin-Williams, Huntington Bank, and Nestle. We typically use a full-stack JavaScript architecture with either Backbone, Angular or React depending on the project along with NodeJS. We also have apps that run with Java or .NET back end.</p>

      <p>Prior to Resource, I've worked professionally on a variety of different software projects using languages like Ruby, Java, Perl, and PHP. My passion, though, has always been building and designing the UI side of the applications with JavaScript.</p>

      <p>My approach to work has always been a combination of software craftsmanship, innovation, continuous learning, and sharing. I take pride in delivering high-quality code that is free of bugs by writing unit tests consistently, performing code reviews, and resolving technical debt where necessary. I enjoy learning new programming languages and identifying strengths and weaknesses in solving problems (areas of interest are functional programming, concurrency and static typing).</p>
